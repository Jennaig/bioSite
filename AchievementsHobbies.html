        <h2>Achievements</h2>
        <p>After moving across the country to the west coast, Philip began his career with the first major project he worked on, the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover mission. For four years, Philip helped develop and edit the code that controlled various parts of the rover including the Super Cam, which detects and collects soil samples and preserves them to be scanned for signs of life. Now that the Mars 2020 rover has left our atmosphere, Philip is working on JPL’s Europa Clipper mission to study one of Jupiter’s mysterious moons.</p>
        <p>The goal of the Mars 2020 Mission is to search for any signs of past or current life on Mars. It took a large and multi-faceted team to complete the M2020 project. The SuperCam, short for super camera, that Philip had a major hand in developing works by remotely surveying rubble and dirt to test the Martian matter for signs of previous life from long ago.</p>
        
        <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system and has only had an exploratory ship sent to orbit it twice before. Past findings conclude that there could be a saltwater ocean under the frozen crust on Europa. The Europa Clipper will be the most technologically advanced spacecraft to ever be sent to survey another planetary form and will be the first mission ever with the sole purpose of exploring a moon that isn’t Earth’s.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Philip has a wide variety of interests and passions, and is always looking for more fun hobbies to pick up.</p>
        <p>In his free time, Philip enjoys doing physical activities such as hiking, going for runs, riding his bike, swimming, and going to the gym. Philip also enjoys weekends at the beach, exploring new restaurants, going to new places, and making travel plans for short adventures. As of now, Philip is working on renewing his passport to travel abroad more in the future.</p>
        <p>Philip comes from a musical family and has picked up various instruments for entertaining both himself and others. Though his main instrument to play is the saxophone, he also plays the piano, ocarina, kalimba, pan flute, and wants to learn more about playing the bass and guitar. He’s even made his own Native American style flute by hand out of carved wood! Philip has also dabbled in painting, drawing, jewelry making, and video game design. He hopes to one day use his skills to design his own video game with originally composed music scoring.</p>
