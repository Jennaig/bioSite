        <p>Philip Romano grew up on the east coast in Maryland, in a small town called Ellicott City.</p>
        <p>As an adolescent Philip had many interests, including playing video games with his older brother and sister, practicing instruments such as the piano and saxophone, and participating in local competitive swimming tournaments. Out of his many interests, being an avid game-player is what led Philip to his current career path. From making unforgettable memories with his older brother on their classic Atari game system, Philip was inspired to learn how to code and bring new opportunities for others to explore, learn, and make cherished memories as he did.</p>
        <p>Letting his interest in game development lead him, Philip attended the University of Maryland, College Park to study computer science and coding. In his senior year Philip worked at the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) as an intern, gaining hands-on knowledge of project based software development. This experience combined with his acuity for attention to detail provided Philip with the edge he needed to be offered a position at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California.</p>
