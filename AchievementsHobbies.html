        <h2>Achievements</h2>
        <p>After moving across the country to the west coast, Philip began his career with the first major project he worked on, the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover mission. For four years, Philip helped develop and edit the code that controlled various parts of the rover including the Super Cam, which detects and collects soil samples and preserves them to be scanned for signs of life. Now that the Mars 2020 rover has left our atmosphere, Philip is working on JPL’s Europa Clipper mission to study one of Jupiter’s mysterious moons.</p>
        <p>The goal of the Mars 2020 Mission is to search for any signs of past or current life on Mars. It took a large and multi-faceted team to complete the M2020 project. The SuperCam, short for super camera, that Philip had a major hand in developing works by remotely surveying rubble and dirt to test the Martian matter for signs of previous life from long ago.</p>
        
        <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system and has only had an exploratory ship sent to orbit it twice before. Past findings conclude that there could be a saltwater ocean under the frozen crust on Europa. The Europa Clipper will be the most technologically advanced spacecraft to ever be sent to survey another planetary form and will be the first mission ever with the sole purpose of exploring a moon that isn’t Earth’s.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Philip Romano grew up on the east coast in Maryland, in a small town called Ellicott City.</p>
        <p>As an adolescent Philip had many interests, including playing video games with his older brother and sister, practicing instruments such as the piano and saxophone, and participating in local competitive swimming tournaments. Out of his many interests, being an avid game-player is what led Philip to his current career path. From making unforgettable memories with his older brother on their classic Atari game system, Philip was inspired to learn how to code and bring new opportunities for others to explore, learn, and make cherished memories as he did.</p>
        <p>Letting his interest in game development lead him, Philip attended the University of Maryland, College Park to study computer science and coding. In his senior year Philip worked at the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) as an intern, gaining hands-on knowledge of project based software development. This experience combined with his acuity for attention to detail provided Philip with the edge he needed to be offered a position at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California.</p>
